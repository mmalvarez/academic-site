<img src="/images/mario-face2.jpg" alt="My Picture" style="width:200px">

I am a Ph.D student in Computer Science, working at the University of California, San Diego under the supervision of [Professor Sorin Lerner](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~lerner/) since the fall of 2014.

My research interests cluster around software verification. In particular, I am interested in lowering the cost of foundationally verifying real-world software using proof assistants such as [Coq](http://coq.inria.fr/), so that realistic software can benefit from the unreasonably strong guarantees foundational verification can provide.

I'm currently involved in the VeriDrones project (which, sadly, does not have its own website), working to use Coq to verify control software for a Pixhawk PX4-based quadrotor.

In my past life (as a Princeton undergraduate) I worked on improving proof automation in the [Verified Software Toolchain](http://vst.cs.princeton.edu/).
